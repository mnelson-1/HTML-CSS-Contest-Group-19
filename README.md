The digital era has transformed how we connect and engage with our communities. In this context, the development of the AlumniConnect website aimed to bridge the gap between alumni and their alma mater, African Leadership University (ALU). The primary objective was to create a centralised platform where university alumni could effortlessly check and participate in upcoming events, fostering a sense of community and engagement. Bearing the name "Alu Connects," the website aspires to be more than a platform; it aims to be a trademark, an emblem of enduring connections and shared experiences.
